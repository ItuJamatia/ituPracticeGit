About the Service. The Service enables Users who are seeking help ("Requesting Users") with various services, including those around the home to connect through the Website or App with third party service professionals (the "Home Service Professionals") who would like to complete the task (the "Home Service") for the Requesting User. The Service provides a platform that connects Requesting Users and Home Service Professionals only. We do not provide or perform Home Services. We are not responsible for the performance of Home Services, nor do we have control over the quality, timing, provision or failure to provide, or any aspect whatsoever relating to the identification, request, or provision of Home Services related, directly or indirectly, to our Service. You must become a registered User by creating a User Account (as defined below) to request assistance and connect with a Home Service Professional. You may access the Service from a computer or mobile device.
Requesting Home Services. A User may use the Service to post a request to have a particular Home Service provided (a "Request"). Such Requests must be clearly worded, correctly provide for the relevant category of service, and be a fair and accurate description of the work to be done. When making a request, the Requesting User is solely responsible for confirming the accuracy of all information provided, including, the work requested to be done and the location at which the Requesting User will require such Home Services (the "Premises"). Each Request is limited to one discrete Home Service to be provided by one or more Home Service Professionals. If a User wishes to obtain help with more than one Home Service, the User must make a separate Request for each Home Service requested. As a Requesting User, by confirming your Request, you understand and agree that you have made an offer, for which a Home Service Professional has the power to accept or reject in his or her sole discretion. Once you have confirmed your Request, you may cancel the job ("Job") without incurring a fee only before such time that the Home Service Professional has departed his or her current location for the Premises. You further acknowledge and understand that the first Home Service Professional who accepts your Request for a Home Service on the terms of your Request may be the Home Service Professional to perform the Home Service. You understand that once a Home Service Professional accepts your Request, we will notify you with information about the Home Service Professional, which may include the Home Service Professional's name, photo, company name, customer service rating, and estimated time of arrival. You will also be able to contact the Home Service Professional by telephone or text message for the sole purpose of communication related to the Home Service Request.
Your Responsibilities. By making a Request, you represent and warrant that you have the right to grant the Home Service Professional access to the at the Premises to perform the Home Services, will be present at the Premises or will have a representative who is 18 years old or older present at the Premises at all times while the Home Service is being performed.

Fees & Payment Terms
Important Clarification Regarding Relationship. Requesting Users contract directly with the Home Service Professionals. We will not be a party to any agreements or contracts for Home Services. We act to coordinate payments between Requesting Users and the Home Services Professional but do not act as a prime contractor for the Home Services and nothing in our involvement in the payment process makes us responsible for the Home Services. Your contract for Home Services is with the Home Services Professional, not with us.
Jiffy Rates. We set the rates for Home Services (the "Jiffy Rate"), which may be provided to you during your Request process. The Jiffy Rate excludes any materials required by the Home Service Professional to complete the Home Service. You acknowledge and agree that the cost of materials will be in addition to the respective Jiffy Rate. We reserve the right to modify or update the Jiffy Rates at any time and in our sole discretion. When submitting a Request for a particular category of Home Service, we may provide you with the Jiffy Rate, but are under no obligation to do so and you hereby agree that it is your responsibility to remain informed about the current Jiffy Rates for the category of Home Service at the time requested.
Minimum Charge. You understand and agree that there is a minimum charge set for each Home Service (the "Minimum Charge"). We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to apply the Minimum Charge for your Job, other than as provided for herein. You understand and agree that we may apply the Minimum Charge to the Job if the Home Service Professional arrives at the Premises prior to any cancellation and within the grace period as set out in the Guidelines (https://intercom.help/jiffy). If we choose to apply the Minimum Charge, we may consider the cost of materials separately from our determination of whether to apply the Minimum Charge.
Home Service Payment and Billing. Requesting Users will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Home Service (the "Invoice"), which will include the pricing terms of the Home Service agreed to between the Requesting User and the Home Service Professional. By submitting a Request, you agree that you will pay for all Home Services requested (including all materials, taxes and late fees, as applicable) (the "Home Service Payment") that may be accrued by or in connection with your User Account, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. You understand and agree that we will be responsible, in our sole discretion, for determining the Home Service Payment amount and any agreement you make directly with the Home Service Professional regarding payment will not apply. The Home Service Payment amount will be largely based on the information the Home Service Professional provides us through the App. For all charges applied to your User Account, we will charge your credit card on file with us according to the agreed upon amount between you and us for the Home Service, and you hereby authorize us to charge your credit card for the amounts due for the Home Service Payment immediately upon the Home Service Professional completing the Job. You also authorize us to pre-authorize a charge to your credit card based on your Request. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, but are under no obligation to place a hold on any Home Service Payment. If your payment does not go through, for any reason, you agree to pay the Home Service Payment amount due within seven (7) days of us sending the Invoice or receipt. You may be charged a cancellation fee or minimum payment if you book or confirm a Home Service Request but cancel it before the Home Service is completed as set out in the Guidelines. You further agree that you are responsible for the timely payment of all Home Service Payments and that any such Home Service Payment made is non-refundable, unless otherwise determined in our sole discretion, which includes our discretion to provide assistance under the Jiffy User Protection Plan (as defined herein). You may use Promotional Credits (as defined below) available in your User Account, if any, as full or partial payment for the Home Service Payments under the terms of this Agreement and any terms or restrictions attached to the Promotional Credits.
Payment Processor. Users are required to provide their credit card or bank account details (as specified in any registration forms provided when registering for your User Account) to us when registering for a User Account. By doing so, you authorize us to provide this information to the third party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") we retain. You acknowledge and agree that the terms of the Payment Processor will govern your agreement and interactions with the Payment Processor and that our terms and policies do not govern and that we have no liability arising from your use of or access to the Payment Processor. You should review the applicable terms and policies of the Payment Processor, including its privacy and data gathering practices. We are not responsible for any arrears by the Payment Processor.
Our Fees. There is currently no charge for your use of the Service, to the extent this includes browsing the Website, downloading the App, Requesting Home Services, and reviewing Home Services provided by Home Service Professionals. We reserve the right to introduce or charge, or change a service fee ("Jiffy Fees") or implement charges for features of the Service as indicated to Users from time to time. Any revised fees will take effect 30 days from the date of posting to the Website, App, or notification to your User Account. If you choose to terminate your User Account after notification of any new or additional fees, you must do so before the 30 day period, after which such charges will be applied to your User Account, if applicable.
